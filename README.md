# CNN Image Classification using Flask

This project shows deploying a trained CNN model for image classification
using a Flask  API. The model was trained in Google Colab and deployed locally.


# Model Explanation
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for image classification.
CNN extracts spatial features using convolution and pooling layers.
The final dense layer outputs class probabilities.
The trained model is saved as an ".h5" file and used for inference.
